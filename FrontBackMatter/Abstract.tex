\chapter*{Abstract} % Abstract name

We investigate one way quantum computation and an associated error correction scheme in order to build a numerical Monte Carlo model for fault tolerance for the model. Though the model is incomplete, we draw conclusions about difficulties in construction of the model and advise improvements that could be made to simulate the system accurately. \\
