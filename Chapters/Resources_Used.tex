The code was compiled using the gfortran compiler using flags -lblas, -llapack and -fopenmp. -g was used for debugging.

OpenMP was employed in the summations for each loop to make use of the laptop's dual core processor.

LAPACK was used in the diagonalisation of matrices to find the eigenvalues of the hamiltonians. 

Data was plotted using gnuplot with a plotting script written for each basis set.
